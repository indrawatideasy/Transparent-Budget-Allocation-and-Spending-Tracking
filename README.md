# Transparent-Budget-Allocation-and-Spending-Tracking
This system is a blockchain-based platform designed to enhance transparency in government financial management. Traditional budget allocation often lacks public visibility, leading to inefficiencies, mismanagement, and potential corruption. This system leverages Ethereum smart contracts to record and track budget allocations in real time, ensuring that fund distribution to government departments or projects is automated and tamper-proof. By providing public access to spending data, it allows citizens, journalists, and watchdog organizations to monitor financial transactions, fostering greater accountability and trust in governance. Through decentralized and immutable records, this solution reduces financial mismanagement, promotes responsible fund utilization, and strengthens public confidence in government operations.

## Project Overview
The system will allow governments or organizations to:
o Allocate budgets to departments or projects.
o Track spending in real-time.
o Provide transparency to stakeholders by recording all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Tech Stack
o Blockchain: Ethereum (Smart Contracts).
o Backend: Python (Flask/Django for API).
o Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (optional, for a user interface).
o Web3 Library: web3.py to interact with Ethereum.
o Testing: Ganache (local Ethereum blockchain for testing).
o Deployment: Infura (to connect to Ethereum mainnet or testnets).
